Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as a way to practice front-end development and DOM manipulation.

- Add income and expense entries
- See a running total of your balance
- Basic categorization (e.g., bills, food, transportation)
- Client-side only (no backend) – runs entirely in the browser

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maximowinfield/finance-planner.git
Open index.html in your browser.

No build step, no backend — just open and go.

📌 Future Improvements (Ideas)

Add localStorage so data persists between refreshes

Add charts for spending by category

Add authentication and a backend in Node.js or .NET

Export data to CSV

🎯 Purpose

This project is meant to demonstrate:

Front-end skills (layout, styling, DOM)

Handling user input and dynamic UI updates

Organizing JavaScript into small, readable functions

Later add a little `<img>` screenshot and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
